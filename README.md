# Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis for Telecommunications

## Problem Statement

A telecommunications company wants to monitor its network traffic in real-time to identify any anomalies or patterns that could indicate issues or opportunities for improvement. The company has a large volume of network traffic data generated every second and needs to process this data in real-time. They also want to be able to visualize the data to provide insights to the network operation team.

## Solution Overview

We develop a real-time network traffic analysis system using Apache Kafka and Structured Spark Streaming. The system will ingest and process network traffic data in real-time and identify any anomalies or patterns. The data will be visualized using a web-based dashboard that provides real-time insights into the network traffic.

## Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

1. **Kafka Cluster:** Set up a Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud and configure Kafka topics for ingesting network traffic data.

2. **Network Traffic Generator:** Implement a Python script using the kafka-python package to generate network traffic data and publish it to the Kafka topic.

3. **Structured Spark Streaming:** Use Structured Spark Streaming to ingest data from Kafka topics and perform real-time analytics on the data.

4. **Anomaly Detection:** Implement stateless transformations such as select, filter, and groupBy to analyze the data in real-time. Use sliding window operations and window-based aggregations to identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.

## Guidelines

The below guidelines will be used to set up and implement the real-time network traffic analysis system:

1. Set up a Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud and create two Kafka topics named "network-traffic" and "processed-data".

2. Implement a Python script using the kafka-python package to generate network traffic data and publish it to the "network-traffic" Kafka topic.

3. Use Structured Spark Streaming to ingest data from the "network-traffic" Kafka topic and perform real-time analytics on the data.

4. Implement sliding window operations to identify patterns in the data, such as sudden spikes or drops in traffic.

5. Use window-based aggregations to identify any anomalies in the data, such as unexpected patterns or traffic from unusual sources.

6. Publish the processed data to the "processed-data" Kafka topic.
